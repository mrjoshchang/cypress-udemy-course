      <h1>About Cypress (PAMM)</h1>
      <p>
        PAMM stands for <b>Page Action Mapping Model</b>. It's a new name for a
        framework that has been around, but hasn't gained much traction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is to be used to learn about the framework and play around
        with different test types: E2E, API, and Component.
      </p>
