              [Verse 1]
              <br />
              I walked through the door with you
              <br />
              The air was cold <br />
              But something about it felt like home somehow <br />
              And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house <br />
              And you've still got it in your drawer even now
            </p>
          </div>

            [Verse 2]
            <br />
            Oh, your sweet disposition <br />
            And my wide-eyed gaze <br />
            We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate <br />
            Autumn leaves falling down like pieces <br />
            into place And I can picture it after all these days
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="pre-chorus1">
            [Pre-Chorus]
            <br />
            And I know it's long gone and <br />
            That magic's not here no more <br />
            And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
            <br /> Oh, oh, oh
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="chorus1">
            [Chorus]
            <br />
            'Causе there we arе again on that little town street <br />
            You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me <br />
            Wind in my hair, I was there <br /> I remember it all too well
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="verse3">
            [Verse 3]
            <br />
            Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red <br />
            You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed <br />
            And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team{' '}
            <br />
            You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me <br />
            And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy" <br />
            Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town <br />
            And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now <br />
            He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was <br />
            'Til we were dead and gone and buried <br />
            Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same <br />
            After three months in the grave <br />
            And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you <br />
            But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame <br />
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="pre-chorus2">
            [Pre-Chorus]
            <br />
            And I know it's long gone and <br />
            There was nothing else I could do <br />
            And I forget about you long enough <br />
            To forget why I needed to <br />
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="chorus2">
            [Chorus]
            <br />
            'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night <br />
            We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light <br />
            Down the stairs, I was there <br />
            I remember it all too well <br />
            And there we are again when nobody had to know <br />
            You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath <br />
            Sacred prayer and we'd swear <br />
            To remember it all too well, yeah <br />
          </p>{' '}

            <br />
            Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
            <br />
            But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
            <br />
            Runnin' scared, I was there
            <br />
            I remember it all too well
            <br />
            And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
            <br />
            So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
            <br />
            I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
            <br />
            'Cause I remember it all, all, all
            <br />
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="verse4">
            [Verse 4]
            <br />
            They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell <br />
            Every time you double-cross my mind <br />
            You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine{' '}
            <br />
            And that made me want to die <br />
            The idea you had of me, who was she? <br />
            A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you <br />
            Not weepin' in a party bathroom <br />
            Some actress askin' me what happened, you <br />
            That's what happened, you <br />
            You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes <br />
            Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show <br />
            But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you
            to come <br />
            And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one" <br />
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="verse5">
            [Verse 5]
            <br />
            Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
            <br />
            I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
            <br />
            After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
            <br />
            Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
            <br />
            But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
            <br />
            'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
            <br />
            You can't get rid of it
            <br />
            'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
            <br />
          </p>{' '}
          <p data-cy="chorus3">
            [Chorus]
            <br />
            'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
            <br />
            Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
            <br />
            It was rare, I was there
            <br />
            I remember it all too well
            <br />
            Wind in my hair, you were there
            <br />
            You remember it all
            <br />
            Down the stairs, you were there
            <br />
            You remember it all
            <br />
            It was rare, I was there
            <br />
            I remember it all too well

            [Verse 6]
            <br />
            And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
            <br />
            "I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
            <br />
            From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
            <br />
            I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
            <br />
            And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
            <br />
            Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
            <br />
            'Cause in this city's barren cold
            <br />
            I still remember the first fall of snow
            <br />
            And how it glistened as it fell
            <br />
            I remember it all too well
            <br />

            <br />
            Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well? <br />
            Just between us, do you remember it all too well? <br />
            Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well <br />
            Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there) <br />
            Down the stairs, I was there, I was there <br />
            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there <br />
            It was rare, you remember it all too well <br />
            Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh) <br />
            Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there) <br />
            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there <br />
            It was rare, you remember it (All too well) <br />
            Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there <br />
            Down the stairs, I was there, I was there <br />
            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there <br />

            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there <br />
